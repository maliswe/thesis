% Abstract (one-column format as required by IEEE)
\begin{abstract}
Generative AI is transforming software development by enhancing productivity through automated coding assistance. However, while AI-assisted tools such as GitHub Copilot accelerate development, they introduce security vulnerabilities that may compromise software integrity. This study employs a mixed-methods approach, combining surveys of developers and code analysis, to investigate the trade-offs between efficiency and security risks. The findings aim to provide actionable insights for balancing rapid development with secure coding practices, benefiting both industry practitioners and researchers.
