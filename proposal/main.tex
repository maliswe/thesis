% Abstract
\begin{customabstract} Generative AI is rapidly transforming software development by enhancing productivity.
AI-assisted tools accelerate coding, yet they introduce notable security challenges.
This proposal examines the trade-offs between efficiency and potential vulnerabilities.
A mixed-methods approach, including surveys and code analyses, will be used to explore these issues.
The goal is to offer insights that balance development speed with secure coding practices. \end{customabstract}
