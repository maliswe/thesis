\section{Research Questions}
This study aims to answer the following research questions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{RQ1:} What security risks emerge in AI-generated code?
    \item \textbf{RQ2:} How can developers balance efficiency and security when using AI tools?
    \item \textbf{RQ3:} How do different AI-assisted coding tools compare in terms of security vulnerabilities?
\end{itemize}

A structured investigation will provide insights into optimizing AI-assisted development while mitigating risks.
